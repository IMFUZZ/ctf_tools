# Useful tools for CTF challenges!

## Description:

This is a bunch of linux tools that are pretty commonly used during hacking competitions. Most of them require a bash shell so linux-based system are the most recommended systems to use during these events.

Note: Most of them work on MacOS and can, in some cases, work on Windows system using third party softwares of Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (Which is really not recommanded).

The following section provides a list of tools and resources for specific challenges categories (Russian-doll, Pen-testing, forensic, etc..)
